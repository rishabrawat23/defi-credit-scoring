Analysis of Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scores
This document presents an analysis of the credit scores generated for wallets on the Aave V2 protocol. The scores were calculated using the generate_scores.py script.

Score Distribution
The following graph shows the distribution of credit scores across all wallets in the dataset.

Observations:
Concentration in the Mid-Range: The majority of wallets are clustered in the 400-600 score range. This suggests that a large portion of users exhibit "average" behavior, with a mix of positive and negative indicators.

Skewness: The distribution is slightly skewed to the right, indicating a smaller number of wallets with very high scores.

Low-Score Outliers: There is a noticeable group of wallets with very low scores (0-200), likely representing high-risk users or bot activity.

Behavior of Wallets by Score Range
Low-Score Wallets (0-300)
Wallets in this range typically exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

Liquidations: A significant number of these wallets have been liquidated at least once. This is the strongest factor driving scores down.

Low Repayment Ratio: These wallets often have a low ratio of repayments to borrows, indicating they may not be paying back their loans in full or on time.

Short History: Many of these wallets are relatively new, with a short transaction history.

High-Frequency, Low-Value Transactions: Some of these wallets show patterns consistent with bot activity, such as a high number of transactions with very small USD values.

Mid-Range Wallets (301-700)
These wallets represent the "average" DeFi user. Their behavior is generally responsible, but may include some less-than-optimal patterns:

Balanced Activity: They typically have a healthy mix of deposits, borrows, and repayments.

No Liquidations: Most wallets in this range have never been liquidated.

Moderate Ratios: Their repayment-to-borrow ratios are often close to 1, but not always perfect.

Established History: These wallets tend to have been active for a moderate period.

High-Score Wallets (701-1000)
These are the "power users" of the Aave protocol and are considered the most reliable. Their characteristics include:

Long-Term Activity: They have a long and consistent transaction history.

High Value and Volume: They have high total transaction counts and significant USD value in deposits.

Excellent Repayment History: Their repayment-to-borrow ratio is consistently high, often well above 1.

No Liquidations: These wallets have a perfect record with no liquidations.

Diversified Portfolio: They often interact with a wider range of assets on the protocol.

Conclusion
The heuristic-based scoring model effectively differentiates between wallets with varying levels of risk and responsibility. The analysis reveals clear behavioral patterns associated with different score ranges, validating the logic of the model. The score provides a valuable at-a-glance metric for assessing the creditworthiness of a wallet on the Aave V2 protocol.
